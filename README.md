<h1 align="center">yotta-code-quality · 元质 (Yuanzhi)</h1>

<p align="center">A pair-style code review skill for <b>Cursor / Codex / Claude Code / generic agents</b>. It turns "code quality review" into a reusable, configurable, methodology-backed skill: before delivery, the agent reads the code like a senior engineer, locates decay, and proposes evidence-based fixes.</p>

<p align="center">One-line positioning: <b>diagnose first, fix second — report only, never touch the code.</b></p>

## Core value

- **Evidence-based, not gut feeling.** The methodology is distilled from 12 classic software-engineering books (Fowler's *Refactoring*, McConnell's *Code Complete*, Ousterhout's *A Philosophy of Software Design*, Evans's *Domain-Driven Design*, and more); every finding anchors to a concrete book principle or code smell.
- **Iron Law against noise.** Every finding must follow `Symptom → Source → Consequence → Remedy`; findings missing "Consequence" or "Remedy" are treated as noise and not reported.
- **Read-only by default, diagnose before fix.** Reports only, no code changes; unless you explicitly ask for `--fix` (apply Remedy).
- **Trackable Health Score.** Each review produces a 0–100 point-deduction index (deliberately defined as a *per-review deduction index*, not an absolute rating) supporting cross-review trend comparison.
- **On-demand loading, not bloated.** By mode (Quick / PR / architecture / tests / release) only the needed reference files are read, keeping the full methodology out of context.
- **Cross-agent + zero dependency.** A pure file-based skill, usable in Cursor / Codex / Claude Code / generic agents; no runtime dependencies.

## Why use it

| Dimension | yotta-code-quality | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Methodology | 12 classic SE books + smells | Every finding traceable, not empirical talk |
| Finding structure | Iron Law four-part | Forces "consequence + remedy", avoids useless griping |
| Scoring | Per-review deduction index (0–100) | Explicitly "not an absolute rating", resists misreading, supports trends |
| Coverage | R1–R6 + T1–T6 + R7 + UX1 | Production, tests, release/supply-chain, first-paint UX |
| Config | `.code-quality.yaml` | Enable/disable/degrade/ignore/focus per risk, adapts to the project |
| Trigger | Conversational | "结对评审" / "发版前扫一眼" also hit |
| Extras | AGENTS-template / hooks.json | Optional; not required for the review core |

## Workflow (protocol in brief)

### Iron Law (non-negotiable)

```
NEVER suggest fixes before completing risk diagnosis.
EVERY finding must follow: Symptom → Source → Consequence → Remedy.
Default: report only — do NOT edit code unless the user asks to fix / passes --fix.
```

### Session contract

1. **Read-only by default** — report only, no opportunistic refactors.
2. **Scope discipline** — stay within the files / diff / "knife" the user names.
3. **Health Score is not a rating** — it is a *per-review deduction index*, not an objective score of the codebase.
4. **Language** — the report uses the user's language; Iron Law field names, book titles, smell names and fixed table headers (`Findings` / `Summary` / `Critical` / `Warning` / `Suggestion`) stay in English.

### On-demand loading (mode routing)

| Mode | When | Read first | Read if needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Quick** | pasted function / < 50-line diff / quick look | `SKILL.md` + cheat sheet | `decay-risks.md` |
| **PR review** | PR / branch diff / ready to merge | `common.md` + `pr-review-guide.md` | `decay-risks.md` / `test-decay-risks.md` / `examples.md` |
| **Architecture / tech debt** | whole module / audit / `--full` | `common.md` + `decay-risks.md` + `source-coverage.md` | `editorial-extensions.md` |
| **Test quality** | tests / coverage / flaky | `common.md` + `test-decay-risks.md` | `examples.md` |
| **Release / publishing** | pre-release / updater / CSP / secrets | `common.md` + `editorial-extensions.md` | R1–R6 tables |

### Health Score

Base 100, deducted by `strictness`, floor 0. **Every finding is still reported**; the score is only a trend reference.

| Preset | Critical | Warning | Suggestion |
|---|---|---|---|
| `strict` | −20 | −8 | −2 |
| `balanced` (default) | −15 | −5 | −1 |
| `legacy-friendly` | −8 | −3 | −1 |

### Config (`.code-quality.yaml`)

Read from the repo root before review (single source of truth lives in references/common.md):

```yaml
strictness: balanced
disable: []
severity: {}
ignore:
  - "**/*.generated.*"
  - "**/node_modules/**"
suppress: []
history: false
```

### Optional flags

- `--fix` / "apply Remedy" → fix mode (minimal changes per Remedy, then re-review those findings)
- `--triage` / "handle one by one" → interactive ignore / defer (written to `suppress`)
- `.code-quality.yaml` with `history: true` → generates `.code-quality-history.json` trend records

> The optional extras `AGENTS-template.md` and `hooks.json` do not affect review when not installed.

## Risk matrix (canonical)

| Code | Name | Diagnosis focus |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | Cognitive Overload | How much brainpower does this code take to read |
| R2 | Change Propagation | How many unrelated places break when one thing changes |
| R3 | Knowledge Duplication | Is the same decision scattered across places |
| R4 | Accidental Complexity | Is it more complex than the problem itself |
| R5 | Dependency Disorder | Is the dependency direction consistent |
| R6 | Domain Model Distortion | Does it stay faithful to the domain language |
| T1 | Test Obscurity | Is it clear what is being verified |
| T2 | Test Brittleness | Broken by behavior-equivalent refactors |
| T3 | Test Duplication | Same scenario repeated without added value |
| T4 | Mock Abuse | Is the test more complex than the behavior |
| T5 | Coverage Illusion | Does the suite really protect the points that break |
| T6 | Architecture Mismatch | Does the suite shape match the risk profile |
| R7 | Release / supply-chain security | Plaintext secrets, updaters skipping verification, shipping with DevTools |
| UX1 | First-paint / state clarity | Blank windows, non-centered splash, state copy mismatching the gate |

> Detailed symptoms, book sources, severities and the "no-false-positive list" live in references/decay-risks.md, references/test-decay-risks.md and references/editorial-extensions.md. `anti-over-flag` suppresses noise warnings before reporting R1 etc., to avoid "crying wolf" fatigue.

## Install

Pick any one of the three methods; skill files are fetched from **npm** (GitHub is slower without a proxy; npm can use a domestic mirror).

### Method 1: npm (recommended, one-liner)
```bash
# domestic mirror (optional): npm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com
npx -y @yottameta/yotta-code-quality -g
npx -y @yottameta/yotta-code-quality --dir <your-skills-dir>   # any agent: install to a specific directory
```
> Not in the preset list? Use --dir to point at the agent's skills directory, or manual copy (method 3). --list shows each agent's default directory. You can also npm pack @yottameta/yotta-code-quality and unpack it to install via method 2 / 3.

### Method 2: install.sh one-shot
```bash
bash install.sh -g    # user level; bash install.sh --list shows all directories
bash install.sh --agent codex   # specific agent (--list shows available ones)
bash install.sh       # project level: auto-detect existing .claude/.cursor/.codex skills dirs
bash install.sh --dir /path/to/skills
```
> Covers 17 agent families including Trae / Qwen / Comate / CodeBuddy / Kimi. Windows users: works with Git Bash; otherwise use method 3.

### Method 3: manual copy
Copy the whole `yotta-code-quality` folder into the target agent's skills directory. Common locations (user level; Windows uses %USERPROFILE%, Linux/macOS uses ~):

| Agent | User-level directory | Project-level directory |
|---|---|---|
| Codex | %USERPROFILE%\.codex\skills\yotta-code-quality\ | .codex\skills\ |
| Claude Code | %USERPROFILE%\.claude\skills\yotta-code-quality\ | .claude\skills\ |
| Cursor | %USERPROFILE%\.cursor\skills\yotta-code-quality\ | .cursor\skills\ |
| Windsurf | %USERPROFILE%\.codeium\windsurf\skills\yotta-code-quality\ | .windsurf\skills\ |
| opencode | %USERPROFILE%\.config\opencode\skills\yotta-code-quality\ | .opencode\skills\ |
| Gemini | %USERPROFILE%\.gemini\skills\yotta-code-quality\ | .gemini\skills\ |
| Goose | %USERPROFILE%\.config\goose\skills\yotta-code-quality\ | .goose\skills\ |
| Amp | %USERPROFILE%\.config\agents\skills\yotta-code-quality\ | .agents\skills\ |
| Kiro | %USERPROFILE%\.kiro\skills\yotta-code-quality\ | .kiro\skills\ |
| WorkBuddy | %USERPROFILE%\.workbuddy\skills\yotta-code-quality\ | .workbuddy\skills\ |
| Trae Code CLI | %USERPROFILE%\.traecli\skills\yotta-code-quality\ | .traecli\skills\ |
| Trae IDE (CN) | %USERPROFILE%\.trae-cn\skills\yotta-code-quality\ | .trae\skills\ |
| Qwen Code | %USERPROFILE%\.qwen\skills\yotta-code-quality\ | .qwen\skills\ |
| Comate | %USERPROFILE%\.comate\skills\yotta-code-quality\ | .comate\skills\ |
| CodeBuddy | %USERPROFILE%\.codebuddy\skills\yotta-code-quality\ | .codebuddy\skills\ |
| Kimi | %USERPROFILE%\.kimi\skills\yotta-code-quality\ | .kimi\skills\ |
| Generic AGENTS.md | %USERPROFILE%\.agents\skills\yotta-code-quality\ | .agents\skills\ |

> If Codex's CODEX_HOME is set, it overrides the default; the same applies to opencode's XDG_CONFIG_HOME. .agents\skills is not a universal directory — only OpenCode / Cursor / Cline / Amp / Kimi / Gemini CLI / GitHub Copilot etc. read it; **Claude Code and Codex do not read it by default**. When unsure, use --dir or let the agent install it.

## Usage

Say "review this PR", "结对评审" or "发版前扫一眼" in conversation, or call `/yotta-code-quality` directly. Optional flags are listed above.

### Example: Quick review (pasted function)

```
User: 帮我看看这段函数有没有问题 / 结对评审
Agent: Quick mode → read SKILL + cheat sheet → output Findings + Health Score
```

### Example: PR review (7-step flow)

```
User: review this PR / ready to merge?
Agent: PR mode → .code-quality.yaml config → auto scope → 7 steps in pr-review-guide.md
       → output Findings (Critical/Warning/Suggestion sorted) + fix-order suggestion
```

### Example: wire into a project and configure

```bash
# 1. Put a .code-quality.yaml at the repo root (optional)
# 2. Trigger a review in conversation, or use --dir to install the skill into the target agent
```

## Upgrade / uninstall

- **Upgrade**: rerun the install command to overwrite with the latest (npm: `npx -y @yottameta/yotta-code-quality -g`; install.sh: rerun inside the skill folder). Version is on npm.
- **Uninstall**: delete the `yotta-code-quality/` folder under the target agent's skills directory.
- **No side effects**: the skill writes nothing outside the project; the optional trend file (`.code-quality-history.json`) is only generated when you enable `history: true`, at the repo root.

## FAQ

- **How is this different from generic code review or a linter?** Generic tools are mostly rule/style based; this skill provides "methodology grounding + Iron Law four-part + per-review deduction index", focusing on systemic decay (complexity, propagation, duplication, dependencies, domain modeling, test and release safety) rather than style nitpicking.
- **Does the Health Score judge code quality with a "grade"?** No. It is a *per-review deduction index*, explicitly not an absolute rating, used for cross-review trend comparison.
- **Will it change my code directly?** Report only by default; only with `--fix` / "apply Remedy" does it edit, and then in the smallest behavior-equivalent way.
- **Want to review only some risk classes?** Use `disable` / `focus` / `severity` in `.code-quality.yaml`.
- **Is `.agents/skills` universal?** No. Claude Code and Codex do not read it by default; use --dir when unsure.
- **Does it need network or dependencies?** No. It is a zero-dependency pure file skill; running only relies on the host agent's file-reading ability.
